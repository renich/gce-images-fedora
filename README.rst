gce-images-fedora
=================

Description
-----------
Tools to roll your own Fedora image for Google Compute Engine.

Currently, I will be using 2 methods for building the images.

virt-builder
    Because it just works and it works great.

imagefactory/oz
    Because it's the way real men build images (The Fedora Cloud SIG).

Goals
-----
* Build an image that is 100% compilant with GCE.
* Help you to build your own images however you think it's best.
